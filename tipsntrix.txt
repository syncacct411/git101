Make sure you can start your editor from the terminal by adding the following line to your .bash_profile 

alias subl="/Applications/Sublime\ Text\ 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl"



git diff commit1 commit2	#COMPARE TWO COMMITS
git diff 			#COMPARE WORKING-DIRECTORY AGAINST STAGING-AREA
git diff --staged		#COMPARE THE STAGING AGAINST THE REPOSITORY 

git log --graph --oneline master experimental 	#SHOW CHANGES BETWEEN "master" AND "experimental" ON ONE LINE

git show commit2	#SHOW CHANGES THAT WERE MADE/INTRODUCED COMPARED TO ITS PARENT

git merge master experimental	#MERGE BRANCHES; BESURE YOU'RE ON "master" BRANCH

git branch -d experimental	#REMOVE/DELETE A BRANCH LABEL, BUT KEEPING ALL COMMITS ON THAT BRANCH

git remote add origin https://github.com/syncacct411/git101.git








git config --global core.editor "'/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl' -n -w"
git config --global push.default upstream
git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3


(Instead of the first command, you may be able to use the simpler git config --global core.editor "subl -n -w" as shown in the video, but many students have found this does not work for them.)


Force the .bash_profile to execute. This loads the values immediately without having to reboot. In your Terminal window, run the following command.

source ~/.bash_profile


HEAD - CURRENT COMMIT
