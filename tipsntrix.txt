Make sure you can start your editor from the terminal by adding the following line to your .bash_profile 

alias subl="/Applications/Sublime\ Text\ 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl"




git config --global core.editor "'/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl' -n -w"
git config --global push.default upstream
git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3

(Instead of the first command, you may be able to use the simpler git config --global core.editor "subl -n -w" as shown in the video, but many students have found this does not work for them.)
