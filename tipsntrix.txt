Make sure you can start your editor from the terminal by adding the following line to your .bash_profile 

alias subl="/Applications/Sublime\ Text\ 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl"



git diff id1 id2	#COMPARING TWO COMMITS

git diff 	#COMPARING WORKING-DIRECTORY AGAINST STAGING-AREA
git diff --staged	#COMPARING THE STAGING AGAINST THE REPOSITORY 




git config --global core.editor "'/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl' -n -w"
git config --global push.default upstream
git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3

(Instead of the first command, you may be able to use the simpler git config --global core.editor "subl -n -w" as shown in the video, but many students have found this does not work for them.)




Force the .bash_profile to execute. This loads the values immediately without having to reboot. In your Terminal window, run the following command.

source ~/.bash_profile
